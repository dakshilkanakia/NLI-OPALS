            <p class="question-text">This item refers to teachers’ promotion of children’s persistence and learning during outdoor play time. Persistence happens when children spend prolonged and continued amounts of time and energy in one type of activity (e.g., symbolic play, nature exploration, climbing up a tree). Teachers can encourage children’s persistence and learning by offering materials, showing how to use materials in a new way, and asking open-ended questions. Expectations for persistence should take into account the developmental level of the children.</p>

Teachers' physical engagement is crucial for children to begin interacting more independently with the outdoor environment, especially for those who are younger or new to the environment. By being physically engaged in the outdoor environment, teachers model inquisitiveness and exploration. Teachers can offer and start activities, or they can be physically engaged in children’s play.</p>

If children already have positive peer interactions, teachers may praise positive peer interactions.</p>
